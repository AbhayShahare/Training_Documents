	Module - 1 :	Intro. to DevOps.
	
	Software --> What it is ?
			- Any Computer Application/Programs 
			
	
	How Software is Developed?
	What are the various process involved in Software Developement?
	What is the Software Development LifeCycle ?
	
	Sofware :::
	
		- Application Software
			Banking/Healthcare/E-Commerce,.....
		- System Software 
			Operating System/Middleware products
			Micro-chip level programming/Embedded Application 
			
	Software Developement Life Cycle - (SDLC)
		
		- Requirement Analysis
		- Design Phase 
		- Coding/Implementation
		- Testing 
		- Deployment
		- Maintenance/Monitoring
		
	Application :::
	
		Desktop Application 
		Web Application 
		Mobile Application 
		
		
	Software Developement Life Cycle - (SDLC)
		
		- Requirement Analysis
		- Design Phase 
		- Coding/Implementation
		- Testing 
		- Deployment
		- Maintenance/Monitoring	
		
		
	Waterfall Model ::: Is a Traditional/Legacy SDLC Process/Model 
						It is Linear in fashion --> Means the process is in sequential.
		
	
E_Commerce Application -> 

		6 Months, 10+2 Modules/Function, tools, supportive components 

		
	Waterfall::

	Agile Methodology can be used to achieve :
		Continuous Development 
		Continuous Integration
		Continuous Delivery 		--> Requires Manual Approval for Prod release.
		
		Continuous Deployment 		--> Doesnt require any manual intervention/Approval for prod release.
		
	We cannot Achieve Continuous Deployment using Agile.
	
	
	DevOps ::::
	
		DevOps is a Software Development Strategy/Process, which helps to promote collaboration with the teams like Development Team and Operations Team to achieve Continuous Developement, Continuous Integration, Continuous Testing, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment and Continuous Monitoring, in an automated fashion.	
	
		- Requirement Analysis
		- Design Phase 
		- Coding/Implementation
		- Testing 
		- Deployment
		- Maintenance/Monitoring
		
	Terminologies :::
	
		Teams Involved in the SDLC process ?
		
			IT - is responsible:
		
					- Infra-Structure Provision Team 
					- Application Development Team - Application Owners/Architects/Leads/Developer
					- Testing Team - UT/QA/UAT/..... 
					- Release Management Team - For timely prod release
					- Production Support Team 
					- Production Monitoring Team
						Infra-Structure/Application
					- Security Team
				
			Why DevOps:::: ????	
				
			Tele-comm Domain - Service Providers1 ==> Introduce a New Offer/Service to their customers 
			Tele-comm Domain - Service Providers2 ==> 

		Environments:::
		
			Developer 	--> to do development I need Developement Environments
			Tester 		--> Test Environments
			Release		--> Production Environments
			
			Non-Prod Environments									Production Environment
			
				Dev - code - build - unit testing 
				Test 
					QA 
					UAT 						======>					Prod_Environment
		
		What is the role of DevOps Team ??? where they fit in  SDLC Process ??
		
				DevOps Team:
					- Infra-Structure Provision Team 
					- Application Development Team - Application Owners/Architects/Leads/Developer
					- Testing Team - UT/QA/UAT/..... 
					- Release Management Team - For timely prod release
					- Production Support Team 
					- Production Monitoring Team
						Infra-Structure/Application
					- Security Team	

			DevOps is all about People, Process and Tools
		
		DevOps Team:
				DevOps Associate
				Sr. DevOps Associate
				DevOps Engineers
				DevOps Lead 
				Sr. DevOps Lead 
				DevOps Architects
				DevOps Consultants 
				SRE 
		
		
		
		DevOps Need - Scripting Knowledge. 
						Python, Shell, Groovy, Yaml 
						
					- Should know how the Applications are Developed, Built, Tested & Deployed.
		
Next :		
		DevOps Stages ::::

#######################
Day 2 - 27th July 2023 
#######################		

			DevOps is a Software Development Strategy/Process, which helps to promote collaboration with the teams like Development Team and Operations Team and automate the end-to-end Software development process.
		
			
			
			Infra-Structure Provision & Configuration :::: 
					Infra-Structure As Code - IAC Tools 
							Terraform		==> Provision/Create the virtual Machines/servers
							Ansible 		==> Configuration Management ==> Install/Remove/Upgrade any tools 
							
							
							
							
			Continuous Development
			
			Sofware Development :::
			
				Developers --> Coding --> Java/C#/Python/Angular/NodeJS		==> Used to Develop Business Logics.
							Eg.: www.amazon.com - E_Commerce 
						Coding	- Sign_Up_Module --> *.java (High Level Language) 
								IDEs -- Integrated Development Environment -- Eclipse - Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Pycharm, Intellj
								Code the application and save it in a source code repository(GIT) Jenkins
								
						Application build 	--> It is a process of compiling the source code and creating artifacts(Binaries - *.war/*.jar/*.exec)
										Build Tools ---> Maven/Gradle/Ant --> Jenkins
						Perform Unit Testing  --> Automate Unit Testing (Using Maven Integration) Jenkins 
						Promote the application for further testing (QA/UAT-Envi.) - Jenkins
						Notify the Testing Team thru email.  Jenkins(Build Orchestration Tool)
						
			
			
			Continuous Integration :::	It is a capability of developers to continuously integrate the code for further testing.
						Promote the application for further testing (QA/UAT-Envi.) - Jenkins
									QA  -  Quality Assurance Testing
									UAT -  User Acceptance Testing
						Notify the Testing Team thru email.  Jenkins(Build Orchestration Tool)
					
					signin.java ==> 2500 lines of codes
						10 lines of changes 
			
			Continuous Testing
						QA  -  Quality Assurance Testing  --> TestNG/Selenium --> Jenkins 
			
			Continuous Delivery/ Deployment 
				==>  It is just a process of copying the application artifacts from lower environment to higher environment
								
				--> These are refered to Production Release.
				Continuous Delivery		===> It requires Manual approval for Prod. release
				
				Continuous Deployment	===> It is completely automated - No Approvals are needed to perform the prod release.
				
						Ansible/Jenkins/Docker/Kubernetes

			Non-Prod Environments									Production Environment
			
				Dev - code - build - unit testing 
				Test 
					QA 
					UAT 						======>					Prod_Environment
					
					
			Deployment Window :::: 
			
			Continuous Delivery :::
				Online Banking!!!! Prod Deployment Window --> 4 to 6 Hrs.
						If deployment is successful 
						If it failed????
							Try to fix the issue within the deployment window 
							If it is not possible to fix, then the changes will be reverted.
							
			Continuous Deployment :::
			
				Starting from Application Build, UT, Code promotion, QA, UAT, Prod Release ==> is completely Automated.
			amazon.com
			netflix 
			
			Continuous Monitoring
					
					-> Infra-Structure Monitoring - Jenkins
								Prometheus/Grafana/					
							
					-> Application Monitoring
								AppDynamics
			

			
			Software Application ::
			
				Mobile/Web/Desktop Applications
				
			Legacy applications architecture : 
					
					Monolith Application Architecture  :::
						
							The Application Components are tightly coupled.
							
					Micro-Service Based Application Architecture :::
					
							The Application is splitted into various services.
							It is loosely coupled.
							
			
			
			www.amazon.com - E_Commerce  ::::

			Developers's Perspective ::::
			
						sign_up ==> --> 3 - tier Architecture
										FrontEnd,Application_Logic,BackEnd(Database) SQL/ORACLE
						
			
			Sign_up			---> (Micro-service) Developer will make the code change --> test --> QA/UAT/ --> Released to Prod.
