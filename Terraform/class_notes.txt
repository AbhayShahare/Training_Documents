			Terraform Work flow:
			
				1. Identify the scope for the servers/Environment - AWS/AZ/GCP/
				2. Initialize the Provider 		# Install the Provider for terraform in the local machine. 
				3. Create/customise the terraform script.
				4. Execute terraform plan		# It is used to verify the script and the resource definition. 
				5. Execute terraform apply		# It is used to actually provision the resources.
